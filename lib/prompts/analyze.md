Now that the conversation is finished, please analyze the user's proficiency levels based on the discussion.

1. Analyze the conversation and determine how much the user has improved in each topic based on the words they used.
2. **Check the proficiency levels from the very first message** (where the user sent their name and proficiency levels). Use this as the starting point for the re-analysis.
3. Update the proficiency levels accordingly in the format of a JSON array, where each item has:
   - **name**: The skill name (e.g., "Weather", "Food", etc.)
   - **diff**: The difference in proficiency level.

Please ensure that the proficiency levels are adjusted to reflect the words and topics the user engaged with during the conversation. If the user demonstrated a deeper understanding of a topic, **increase the proficiency level slightly**, but don't make significant changes from just one conversation. Small adjustments are preferred, especially since proficiency increases with repeated practice.

If the conversation touched on topics not previously recorded in the proficiency levels, consider them now and **add new entries** for those topics, but **keep the increase small** (e.g., 3 points or less), based on the user's demonstrated understanding during the conversation.

If the user didn't fully address a topic, or only used limited vocabulary related to it, either **leave the proficiency level the same or decrease it slightly**.

Use your judgment to adjust the levels realistically based on the conversation. Keep in mind that proficiency doesn't change drastically from a single conversation, so any updates should reflect gradual improvement over time.
