You will be given a small text in which a chatbot introduces a character and suggests a topic for small talk with the user.

Extract the following information from this text and put it into a JSON format:
- **name**: The name of the chatbot character. Make sure to extract the **full name of the bot** and **not** of the user.
- **title**: Create a short but detailed title for the upcoming conversation, e.g., "Casual conversation with a friend about weather", "Formal discussion with a co-worker about upcoming plans".
